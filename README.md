# Auto_Ecommerce
Autonomous Program for E-commerce


This contains two sections, one that is an auto message response and the other uploads products from Shopify products page to FB Marketplace. This use the Keyboard Maestro Software to allow commands to be made.

The first program goes through the FB messenger UI and checks each message chain. It will check if its a marketplace message or personal, going to the next if its a personal message. If it continues it check ifs its already contacted the customer and then determines the product the message is related to then send an appropriate message with the link. then continues on to the next message.

The next program will copy each product from Shopify and upload it to facebook marketplace, including photos, description etc.

Please note this unique for my products, machine and store. This can be easily varied to meet anyone requirements.
